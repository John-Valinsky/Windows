Stack Implementation Using Array in C++

Q. Write a program to implement a Stack using arrays.



What is a Stack?
================
A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle:

Elements are pushed onto the stack.

The last element pushed is the first one to be popped.



# Features of This Program
==========================
Stack of fixed size (MAX = 100)

Operations:

push(value) – Adds an element to the top.

pop() – Removes the top element.

peek() – Views the top element without removing it.

display() – Displays all elements in the stack.
