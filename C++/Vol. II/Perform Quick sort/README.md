Quick Sort in C++

Q. Write a C++ program to perform Quick Sort on an array.



# Description
=============
This program implements Quick Sort, a highly efficient and commonly used Divide and Conquer sorting algorithm. It uses a pivot to partition the array and recursively sorts the subarrays.



# How Quick Sort Works
======================
Choose a pivot element (here, last element).

Partition the array:

Move all elements smaller than pivot to its left.

Move all greater elements to its right.

Recursively apply the above steps to the left and right subarrays.
