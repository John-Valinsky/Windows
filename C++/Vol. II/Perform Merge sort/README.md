Merge Sort Implementation in C++

Q. Write a C++ program to perform Merge Sort on an array.



# Description
=============
This program implements Merge Sort, a Divide and Conquer based sorting algorithm. It recursively divides the array into halves, sorts them, and merges them back into a single sorted array.



# How Merge Sort Works
======================
Divide: Recursively divide the array into two halves until each sub-array has a single element.

Conquer: Recursively sort the sub-arrays.

Combine: Merge the sorted sub-arrays to produce a sorted whole.
