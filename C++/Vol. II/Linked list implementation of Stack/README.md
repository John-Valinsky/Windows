Linked List Implementation of Stack in C++

Q. Write a C++ program to implement a Stack using Linked List and perform the following operations:

Push

Pop

Peek (Top element)

Check if the stack is empty



# Description
=============
This program implements a stack (LIFO: Last-In-First-Out) using a singly linked list. It performs typical stack operations dynamically without a fixed size, which makes it memory-efficient and flexible.
