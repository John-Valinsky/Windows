Binary Search Implementation in C++

Q. Write a C++ program to implement Binary Search on a sorted array and search for a given element.



# Description
=============
This program implements Binary Search, an efficient algorithm to find the position of an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.



# Key Points
============
Works only on sorted arrays

Repeatedly compares the middle element with the target

Eliminates half of the search space each time
