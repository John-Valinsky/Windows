Circular Queue Using Array in C++

Q. Write a program to implement a Circular Queue using arrays.

Concept: Circular Queue
A Circular Queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle, but the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It's more efficient than a linear queue in utilizing memory.
