Sparse Matrix Representation using Linked List (C++)

Q. Write a C++ program to represent a Sparse Matrix using a linked list.



# Description
=============
This program efficiently stores and represents a sparse matrix — a matrix with mostly zero values — using a linked list. Each non-zero element is stored as a node containing:

Row index

Column index

Non-zero value

This reduces memory usage compared to storing every element in a 2D array.
