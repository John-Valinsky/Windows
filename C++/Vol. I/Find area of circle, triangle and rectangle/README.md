Function Overloading: Area of Circle, Triangle, and Rectangle in C++

# Program Title
===============
Area Calculation Using Function Overloading in C++


# Description
=============
This program demonstrates function overloading in C++. The AreaCalculator class contains multiple area() methods:

One for calculating the area of a circle.

Another for a triangle.

And one more for a rectangle.

Each method has a different parameter list, allowing the compiler to choose the correct one based on the number and types of arguments passed.



# Features
==========
Calculates area of:

Circle (using radius)

Triangle (using base and height)

Rectangle (using length and breadth)

Demonstrates compile-time polymorphism through function overloading.
