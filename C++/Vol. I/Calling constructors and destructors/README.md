Constructor and Destructor Demonstration in C++

# Program Title
---------------
Ways of Calling Constructors and Destructors in C++



# Description
-------------
This program illustrates the different ways constructors and destructors are invoked in C++ using a class named Demo. It includes:

* Default Constructor

* Parameterized Constructor

* Copy Constructor

* Destructor



These constructors initialize objects in different ways, and the destructor is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope.



# Features
----------
Shows how constructors are triggered upon object creation.

Shows how destructors are automatically called when objects are destroyed.

Provides a clear order of execution for object lifecycle events.



# Key Concepts
--------------
Concept	Description
Default Constructor	Invoked when an object is created with no arguments
Parameterized Constructor	Invoked when an object is created with specific arguments
Copy Constructor	Invoked when a new object is created from an existing one
Destructor	Invoked automatically when an object goes out of scope
