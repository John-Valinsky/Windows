Sum of Four Numbers Using Default Arguments in a Member Function

# Program Title
===============
Sum Calculation Using Default Arguments (Class Member Function)



# Description
=============
This program demonstrates the use of default argument passing in a class member function in C++.
The user can input up to four integers, and the program calculates their sum using a single class method.
Any number not entered (or explicitly entered as 0) is treated as zero due to default values.
