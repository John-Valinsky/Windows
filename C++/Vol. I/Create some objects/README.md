# Program Title
===============
Demonstration of Inheritance and Runtime Polymorphism using Person, Teacher, and Student Classes



# Description
=============
This C++ program demonstrates the concepts of:

Class Inheritance

Runtime Polymorphism

Virtual Functions

Virtual Destructors


The base class Person is inherited by two derived classes: Teacher and Student. The program dynamically creates and deletes objects using a base class pointer to showcase polymorphic behavior.
