Person, Teacher, and Student Class Program in C++

# Program Title
===============
Demonstration of Inheritance and Runtime Polymorphism using Person, Teacher, and Student Classes



# Description
=============
This C++ program demonstrates the concepts of:

Class Inheritance

Runtime Polymorphism

Virtual Functions

Virtual Destructors


The base class Person is inherited by two derived classes: Teacher and Student. The program dynamically creates and deletes objects using a base class pointer to showcase polymorphic behavior.



# Features
==========
* Accepts user input for Person, Teacher, and Student details.

* Uses virtual functions to support runtime polymorphism.

* Demonstrates proper use of destructors for clean object destruction.

* Ensures extensibility using inheritance and OOP principles.



# Concepts Covered
==================
Concept	Description
Inheritance	Teacher and Student inherit from Person.
Runtime Polymorphism	Achieved using virtual functions and base class pointers.
Virtual Destructor	Ensures proper destructor chaining when deleting derived objects.
