C++ Program: Sum of Factorial Series (1! + 2! + 3! + … + n!)

# Question
==========
Write a program to print the result of the following series:

1!+2!+3!+...+n!



# Concepts Used
===============
Concept	Description

Factorial	

n!=n×(n−1)×...×1
Looping	Used to iterate from 1 to n and calculate factorial of each term
Function	factorial(int num) helps modularize the logic
