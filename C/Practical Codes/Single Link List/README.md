# Singly Linked List - Insert and Delete Operations in C
--------------------------------------------------------
This C program demonstrates how to implement a singly linked list and perform the following operations:

* Insert elements 61, 16, 8, 27 into the list.

* Delete elements 8, 61, and 27 from the list.

* Display the list after insertions and deletions.



# Features
----------
* Dynamic memory allocation using malloc

* Node insertion at the end

* Deletion of nodes by value

* Simple, beginner-friendly implementation

* Works with any set of integers (not hardcoded)



# Example Output
---------------
After insertion:
Linked List: 61 16 8 27

After deletion:
Linked List: 16



# Code Overview
---------------
Functions included:

* insert(int value) — Inserts a new node at the end of the list.

* delete(int value) — Deletes the first node that matches the given value.

* display() — Displays the current linked list.



# How to Run
------------
Compile the program

	gcc linked_list_operations.c -o linkedlist
	Run the executable
	./linkedlist
