# Merge Sort (Descending Order) in C

This project contains a C program that implements the **Merge Sort** algorithm to sort an array of integers in **descending order**. Merge Sort is a classic divide-and-conquer algorithm with a time complexity of **O(n log n)**, making it highly efficient for large datasets.



# Features
----------
* Accepts dynamic input from the user.
* Implements Merge Sort in descending order.
* Clean and readable code structure.
* Portable and compatible with modern C compilers.



# Algorithm Used
----------------
The program uses the **Merge Sort** algorithm which follows:

1. Divide the array into two halves.
2. Recursively sort both halves.
3. Merge the sorted halves in a **descending** order.



# Sample Output
---------------
Enter number of elements: 8

Enter 8 elements:

Element [1]: 75
Element [2]: 8
Element [3]: 1
Element [4]: 16
Element [5]: 48
Element [6]: 3
Element [7]: 7
Element [8]: 0
