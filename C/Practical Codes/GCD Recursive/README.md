🔁 What is Recursion?
---------------------
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller part of a bigger problem.

Think of it like this: "To solve the big problem, I’ll solve a smaller version of it using the same method."

🧮 Recursive GCD Finder for Three Numbers:
------------------------------------------
This C program calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of three user-input integers using a recursive function.

🔍 What It Does:
----------------
Takes three integers as input from the user.

Uses a recursive function to compute the GCD of two numbers.

Applies it twice to get the GCD of all three numbers.

Prints the result.
