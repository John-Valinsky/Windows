# Infix to Postfix Expression Converter (C Language)

This project is a simple C program that converts an **infix expression** (like `x^y/(5*2)+2`) into a **postfix expression** (also known as Reverse Polish Notation). It uses stack-based logic to apply operator precedence rules correctly.


# Features
----------
* Converts infix expressions with `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, and parentheses
* Handles alphanumeric operands
* Follows proper operator precedence and associativity
* Easy-to-understand C implementation with comments
* Lightweight and CLI-based (no extra libraries needed)


# Requirements
--------------
* C compiler (e.g., `gcc`, `tcc`, `clang`)
* Command-line terminal or IDE that supports C


# Compilation
-------------
* gcc infix_to_postfix.c -o infix_to_postfix
* Run the Program
* ./infix_to_postfix
