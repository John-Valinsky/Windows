ğŸŒ³ Binary Search Tree (BST) in C with Traversals
This C program implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) for a set of user-defined elements. It allows you to:

ğŸ”¹ Create a BST

ğŸ”¹ Display the BST in a tree-like structure

ğŸ”¹ Perform Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder traversals

ğŸ“Œ Sample Input
For example, inserting: {2, 5, 1, 3, 9, 0, 6}
The BST is built using the standard insertion logic:

Values smaller than the node go to the left

Values greater go to the right
