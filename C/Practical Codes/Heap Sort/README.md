# Heap Sort in C (User Input)

This project is a simple C program that implements the **Heap Sort** algorithm using a **Max Heap**. The user provides the input, and the program sorts the array in ascending order.


# Features
----------
* Accepts dynamic input from the user.
* Sorts using Heap Sort algorithm (in-place sorting).
* Validates input size.
* Simple and readable structure.
* Written in standard C (compatible with most compilers).
