# Quick Sort Implementation in C
--------------------------------
This repository contains a simple and efficient implementation of the **Quick Sort algorithm** in C. The program takes an array of integers from the user, sorts it in **ascending order**, and displays the sorted array.



# Description
-------------
Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

This implementation uses the **Lomuto Partition Scheme**, with the first element as the pivot.
