# Postfix Expression Evaluator in C

This project is a simple C program to evaluate **postfix expressions** (also known as Reverse Polish Notation).  
It demonstrates the use of **stacks** and **expression parsing** through manual implementation.



# What is Postfix Notation?
---------------------------
A postfix expression is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands.  
For example, the infix expression:

(5 + 3) * (8 - 2)

is written in postfix as:

53+82-*
