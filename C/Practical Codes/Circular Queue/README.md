# Circular Queue Using Linked List (C Program)

This program implements a Circular Queue using a Linked List in C. It allows for insertion, deletion, and display of elements using dynamic memory management and circular linking.

# Problem Statement
-------------------
Insert the elements {5, 7, 0, 0, 3, 9} into a circular queue and delete 6, 9, and 5 using a linked list implementation.


# Features
-----------
* Circular Queue implementation using singly linked list

* Dynamic memory allocation via malloc()

* Full circular link: rear->link = front

* Menu-driven program


# Supports
----------
* Insertion

* Deletion (FIFO)

* Display of all elements


# Menu Options
--------------
 ****MAIN MENU****

 1. Insert
 2. Delete
 3. Display
 4. Exit


# How It Works
--------------
* Insertion

* If queue is empty: front and rear both point to the new node

* Else: add to rear and update rear->link = front to maintain the circular property

* Deletion

* If only one element: both front and rear set to NULL

* Otherwise: delete the front node and update links accordingly


# Display
---------
* Traverses the circular queue using do...while() until it reaches back to front

* Sample Data


# Insertion Sequence
--------------------
Insert: 5, 7, 0, 0, 3, 9


# Deletion Sequence
-------------------
* Delete: 6 (not present), 9, 5

* Note: Only 9 and 5 will be successfully deleted.


# How to Compile and Run
------------------------
* On Linux / macOS:

	gcc circular_queue.c -o cqueue

	./cqueue


* On Windows (Turbo C++ / Dev C++):

	Paste the code in a .c file inside your IDE

	Compile and run the program


# Functions Included
--------------------
* Function	Purpose
* QInsert()	Insert element at rear of queue
* QDelete()	Delete element from front (FIFO)
* Display()	Print all elements in circular queue
