# Stack Implementation in C using Arrays:
-----------------------------------------
This is a simple menu-driven program written in C that demonstrates how a stack works using a fixed-size array. The program allows users to:

* Push elements onto the stack

* Pop elements from the stack

* Display current stack contents

* Exit the program

# Features:
-----------
* Stack Overflow and Underflow checks

* Clear and easy-to-understand output

* Uses core C concepts like arrays, functions, loops, and conditionals

* Perfect for beginners learning Data Structures

# Stack Details:
----------------
* Max Capacity: 5 elements

* Data Type: Integer

* Implementation Type: Array-based (static)

# How to Run:
-------------
* On Linux / macOS (GCC)

gcc stack_array.c -o stack

./stack


* On Windows (Dev C++ / Code::Blocks)

Copy the code into a .c file (e.g., stack_array.c)

Build and run the file in your IDE
