# String Reverser

A simple interactive C program that reverses user-entered strings in real time.

It runs in a loop, accepts any length of input, reverses it, and clears the screen for the next round.


# Features

* Reverses any string entered by the user.

* Runs continuously until manually stopped.

* Uses dynamic memory allocation (getline).


# Example Output
```bash
 Enter a string   ~ Hello World

 Reversed string  ~ dlroW olleH
```


# How It Works

* Reads user input using getline().

* Removes the newline character.

* Reverses the string using a custom function.

* Displays the reversed string.

* Waits for user input, clears the screen, and repeats.
