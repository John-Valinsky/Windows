Overview

This Java program generates multiplication tables for numbers within a user-defined range. It uses nested loops and simple input validation to ensure correct output.



# Key Concepts
--------------
* User Input via Scanner

* Conditional Statements (if-else)

* Nested Loops (for)

* Input Validation to ensure valid range



# File Description
------------------
Tables.java

This file contains the main class Tables, which:

* Prompts the user to enter the starting and ending number for multiplication tables.

* Validates the input to ensure the start is less than the end.

* Displays multiplication tables from the start to the end number (inclusive), each up to 10 multiples.
