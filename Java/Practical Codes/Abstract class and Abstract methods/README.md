# Abstract Class and Polymorphism Demonstration (Java)

* Overview

This Java program demonstrates the concept of abstraction and runtime polymorphism using an abstract class Shape and its concrete subclasses Rectangle and Triangle. Each shape class overrides the getArea() method to compute its own area.



# File Structure
----------------

AbstractDemo.java    // Main class to test polymorphism
Shape.java           // Abstract base class
Rectangle.java       // Subclass representing a rectangle
Triangle.java        // Subclass representing a triangle



# Concepts Demonstrated
-----------------------
* Abstraction using abstract classes

* Inheritance for code reuse

* Method Overriding

* Runtime Polymorphism via superclass references
