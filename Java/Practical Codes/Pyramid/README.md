# Java Program: Number Pyramid Pattern

Overview

This Java program generates a pyramid pattern using nested loops. It prints a right-aligned pyramid of numbers where each row contains the row number repeated.



# Key Concepts
--------------
* Nested Loops

* Pattern Printing

* Loop Control Structures



# Program Description
---------------------
Class: Pyramid
Contains the main() method.

Utilizes three nested loops:
----------------------------
* One for handling rows.

* One for printing leading spaces (to align the pyramid).

* One for printing the row number repeatedly in each row.



# Output Example
----------------

     1 
    2 2 
   3 3 3 
  4 4 4 4 
 5 5 5 5 5 
 


# How It Works
--------------
* The outer loop (i) runs from 1 to 5, representing the row number.

* The first inner loop (j) prints spaces to align the pyramid.

* The second inner loop (k) prints the current row number (i), repeated i times.

* Each row ends with a System.out.println() to move to the next line.



# Features
----------
* Simple yet effective demonstration of pattern printing logic.

* Enhances understanding of how to align text in console output.
