# Java Program: Method Overriding & Runtime Polymorphism

Overview

This Java program illustrates the concept of method overriding in object-oriented programming and demonstrates runtime polymorphism using a parent and child class.



# Key Concepts
--------------
* Method Overriding: Redefining a parent class method in a subclass.

* Runtime Polymorphism: When a superclass reference refers to a subclass object, the subclassâ€™s overridden method is executed at runtime.

* Dynamic Method Dispatch: The mechanism behind runtime polymorphism.



# Files and Classes
-------------------
* ABC class (Parent Class)

Method: disp()

Prints a message indicating it belongs to the parent class.

* Demo class (Child Class)

Overrides disp() to provide its own implementation.

Adds a new method newMethod().
