# Arithmetic Operators Demonstration â€“ Java Program

Description

This simple Java program demonstrates the usage and behavior of arithmetic operators in Java. It evaluates a series of expressions using fixed integer values and prints the result of each. It highlights operator precedence and associativity.



# Features
----------
* Demonstrates basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /, %

* Shows how operator precedence affects evaluation

* Includes both default and overridden precedence examples using parentheses



# Operations Performed
----------------------
Given the values:

int a = 5, b = 6, c = 3, d = 4, e = 2;
The program evaluates the following expressions:

m = a + b - c

n = a + b - c * d

o = a + b - c * d + d

p = a + b - c * d + d / a

k = a + b - c * d + d / a % b

l = (a + b - c) * (d + d) / a % b
