# Java Program: Reading and Writing Files using FileInputStream & FileOutputStream

Overview
--------
This Java program demonstrates how to read the contents of a file and write them to another file using:

* FileInputStream for reading from a file

* FileOutputStream for writing to a file



# Files Involved
----------------
Input File: sample.txt

Output File: data2.txt

Both files are located at:
C:\Users\John\Desktop\programs\



# Concepts Demonstrated
-----------------------
File I/O in Java

Byte-level reading and writing

Try-catch exception handling

Streams (FileInputStream, FileOutputStream)



# Program Flow
--------------
The readFile() method:

* Opens the input file sample.txt

* Reads its contents byte by byte

* Writes the bytes to the output file data2.txt


Once writing is complete, it prints:

content writen successfully
