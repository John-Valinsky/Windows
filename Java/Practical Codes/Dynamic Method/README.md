# Java Program: Inheritance and Polymorphism Demonstration

* Overview

This Java program demonstrates the concepts of inheritance and runtime polymorphism (method overriding) using a simple game hierarchy.



# File Structure
----------------
* Game.java         // Base class
* Cricket.java      // Subclass inheriting from Game and overriding method
(Note: In your code, both classes are written in the same file. This is valid as long as only one of them is public.)
