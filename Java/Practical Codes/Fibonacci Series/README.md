# Java Program: Fibonacci Series Generator

* Overview

This Java program generates and prints the first t numbers of the Fibonacci series, where t is user-defined input.



# File
------
Fibonacci.java



# Concepts Demonstrated

* Basic Variable Usage



# What is the Fibonacci Series?

The Fibonacci Series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...



# Program Flow
--------------
* Prompt the user to enter how many Fibonacci numbers (t) they want.

* Print the first two terms: 0 and 1.

* Use a loop to generate and print the next t - 2 terms of the sequence.



# Sample Output
---------------
Enter the value of t: 8

The first 8 Fibonacci Series are:

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13



# How to Run
------------
Save the code in a file named Fibonacci.java.

Compile the program:
--------------------
javac Fibonacci.java

Run the program:
----------------
java Fibonacci
