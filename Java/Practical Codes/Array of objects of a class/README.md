# Overview
----------
This Java program demonstrates how to use arrays of objects by managing a small product inventory system. It defines a Product class and creates an array to hold multiple product objects. Each product contains a unique ID and name.



# File Structure
----------------
ArrayOfObjects.java  // Contains both main class and Product class



# Concepts Demonstrated
-----------------------
* Creating and initializing arrays of objects

* Using constructors to initialize object data

* Object-oriented programming (OOP)

* Accessing object methods through an array



# Class Breakdown
-----------------
Product Class

Fields:
-------
int pro_Id — Product ID

String pro_name — Product Name

Constructor:
------------
Initializes product ID and name.

Method:
-------
display() — Displays product information.



# ArrayOfObjects (Main Class)
-----------------------------
* Creates an array of Product objects.

* Initializes each object using the constructor.

* Displays each product using the display() method.



# Sample Output
---------------
Product Object 1:
Product Id = 23907  Product Name = Dell Laptop
Product Object 2:
Product Id = 91240  Product Name = HP 630
Product Object 3:
Product Id = 29823  Product Name = LG OLED TV
Product Object 4:
Product Id = 11908  Product Name = MI Note Pro Max 9
Product Object 5:
Product Id = 43590  Product Name = Kingston USB



# How to Run
------------
Save the code in a file named ArrayOfObjects.java.

Compile the code:
-----------------
javac ArrayOfObjects.java

Run the program:
----------------
java ArrayOfObjects



# Educational Use
-----------------
This program is great for:

* Understanding how to store and manage multiple objects using arrays.

* Practicing class and object creation in Java.

* Strengthening your understanding of constructors and method calling via objects.
